### What is this?

This is a library which can do Styling totally inside of JavaScript. Just like you would do inside of a CSS file. Without having to make everything look gibberish inside you JS file.

Like this:

```
JS("h1").style({
  color: "#ffe570",
  fontFamily: "sans-serif",
});
```

<p style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Also help the development by reporting any bugs. Feel free to contribute to this project. Thanks ‚ù§</p>

### Benefits

- Easy and readable syntax
- Just one JavaScript file. You won't need css
- Extremely lightweight: Only 500B (271B gzipped!)
- Zero dependencies

### CDN

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jstyling/src/jstyling.js">
```

### NPM Installation

```
npm i jstyling
```

### Usage

```
JS("h4").style({
  color: "pink",
  fontFamily: "sans-serif",
});

// Also you can pass in a raw DOMElement
const element = document.querySelector("h4");
JS(element).style({
  color: "pink",
});
```

### Options

```
JS(indentifier).style({
  // Your styles go here!
  fontFamily: "",
  fontSize: "",
  color: "",
  // ...
  // ...
  // Remember, it's all camelCase
});
```

- indentifier: [string] or DOMElement
  - The element you want to style
