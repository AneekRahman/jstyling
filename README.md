### What is this?

This is a library which can do Styling totally inside of JavaScript. Just like you would do inside of a CSS file. Without having to make everything look gibberish inside you JS file.

Like this:

```
JS("body").style({
  backgroundColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.8)",
  paddingBottom: "20%",
});
JS("h1").style({
  color: "#ffe570",
  fontFamily: "sans-serif",
});
```

<p style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Also help the development by reporting any bugs. Feel free to contribute to this project. Thanks ‚ù§</p>

### Benefits

- Extremely lightweight: Only 500B (271B gzipped! You can't go lower than this!)
- No dependency: It's all Pure javascript
- Makes your code readable
